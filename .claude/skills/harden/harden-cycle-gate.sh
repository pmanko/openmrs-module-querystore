# Stop-hook gate for the `harden` skill's termination contract.
#
# The contract: /harden is complete when PHASE 1 HAS CONVERGED and the single Phase 2 pass that
# follows it has run without escalating. It used to be "one cycle produces ZERO edits", and that is
# what this hook enforced for a month of runs that each took hours: an edit count cannot tell a
# polish edit from a substantive one, so a gate keyed on it re-opens the loop on the loop's own
# output, and the confirming work was multiplicative across three nested convergence loops (pass,
# phase, cycle). Not that polish ALWAYS edits -- #298 converged on a cycle whose measured zero
# covers Phase 2 as well, so that universal is false and a fresh reviewer said so. Phase 1's gate is the one that was
# already severity-aware — "a pass that itself found a substantive (non-cosmetic) issue cannot be the
# last pass" — so the run's condition is now keyed on it. A cycle cap was refused twice, and a
# prose-provenance signal at least twice, both on the walk-forward that a cap ends a converged run
# as did-not-converge; this changes what RE-OPENS the loop, never what counts as having finished.
#
# Contract with the skill: at the close of every Phase 1 pass, and again when Phase 2 finishes, it
# writes an entry to the state file below, keyed by the repo it is hardening:
#
#   { "/abs/path/to/repo": { "cycle": 1, "phase1": "converged", "phase2": "done", "edits": 3,
#                            "ts": 1755400000, "override": false, "owner": 10560, "head": "1ec8735a",
#                            "awaiting": [ { "agent": "phase2 quality", "since": 1755400000 } ] } }
#
# `owner` and `unattended` are read below and `head` is the helper's; the example carries the two it
# reads that a reader would not otherwise expect.
#
# `edits` is still written and still reported, and it no longer gates anything. It was never an
# artifact claim — a zero-edit cycle licenses "this process has stopped producing", not "complete" —
# so it stays as the measured fact the report owes and gives up the job it was bad at.
#
# `awaiting` is what lets a cycle wait for its own subagents. Phase 2 spawns them, so a cycle is
# routinely blocked on one with nothing to do but yield — and without this field the gate refuses that
# yield, making a cycle waiting correctly indistinguishable from one that quit. Measured: a Phase 2
# pass blocked on a background agent tripped this hook on every yield and had to burn in-turn sleep
# loops to stay alive. A non-empty, fresh `awaiting` therefore allows the stop; the harness re-invokes
# the session when the agent completes, so yielding mid-await is how the cycle proceeds, not how it
# ends. The obligation is to CLEAR the field on any terminal outcome, so the allow is bounded by
# AWAIT_TTL and an agent that has not returned inside it counts as dead rather than outstanding.
#
# THAT HOLDS IN FULL ONLY FOR AN ATTENDED SESSION. When a `claude -p` turn ends, the process stops a
# background agent still running 600 s later and exits without re-invoking anyone (pr-harden's State
# section carries the measurement). Issue #310 ended so on 2026-08-26, in Phase 2 pass 3 at 1365
# turns and $76.72 with committed work, no PR and ten orphaned worktrees. The allow is therefore
# scoped to attended sessions; see the marker check below.
# Same field, same semantics as pr-harden-gate.sh, which solved this first.
#
# run stamped, no phase1 -> a run is in flight and has stated no verdict. Block.
# phase1 == open        -> another Phase 1 pass is required; this hook blocks the turn from ending.
# phase1 == converged
#   and phase2 == pending -> the one Phase 2 pass has not run yet. Block.
#   and phase2 == done    -> converged; allow.
#
# There is no third `phase2` value for an escalation, and the first draft's was deleted rather than
# repaired. `escalated` was sticky: `--phase1 converged` did not clear it and this file tested it
# BEFORE `phase1`, so a run whose Phase 2 escalated and whose next Phase 1 pass then converged was
# handed back the instruction it had just obeyed, every turn, until the six-hour expiry. An
# escalation resumes Phase 1, which is `phase1: open`, which already blocks -- and `gate-state`
# resets `phase2` to `pending` on every `phase1` write, so the Phase 2 owed after that convergence
# cannot be satisfied by the one that escalated.
# no run AND no phase1  -> an entry from before this contract: the old `edits > 0` rule still
#                          applies, so a run already in flight is not silently disarmed mid-run.
# override == true      -> the skill took the labelled override; allow (the deviation is on the record).
# no entry              -> no harden run in flight here; allow.
#
# FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS. A gate that wedges every future turn in every repo is far worse than one that
# occasionally lets an early stop through, so every ambiguous case allows the stop: no state file,
# unreadable or malformed JSON, no jq, no entry for this directory, an entry that is not an object,
# a `ts` that is present but not a number, an `awaiting` that is not a list of objects, an
# unrecognised `phase1`, a missing or unparseable edits count on a legacy entry, or an entry older
# than STALE_AFTER (a run that was abandoned, crashed, or /clear-ed). An entry that is present, fresh and parseable, and that does
# not say Phase 1 converged with its Phase 2 done, blocks. An unrecognised `phase2` is deliberately
# NOT in the list above: only `done` ends a run and that is decidable without interpreting the value,
# so a stop is not licensed by a word this reader has never heard of.

# WHOSE ENTRY IS THIS? Measured live 2026-08-26
# (~/.claude/skill-lessons/2026-08-26-pwd-keyed-gate-false-positive.md): this state is keyed on the
# CHECKOUT, so an interactive session opened in a checkout the pool was working was stopped by an entry
# belonging to a different live `claude -p /resolve-ticket` run. The entry was present, fresh and
# parseable, so every fail-open case here correctly declined to cover it — they enumerate the cases
# where the ENTRY is unusable, never the case where it is perfectly good and somebody else's. Both
# remedies the block then offers damage the owner: `override: true` disarms the live run's gate for the
# rest of its life, and "continue the phases" puts a second session in one worktree.
#
# So the skill stamps `owner` with its own claude pid (`$PPID` from a tool shell IS that process, and
# the hook is a child of it, so the ancestry test above answers "did I write this entry").
#
# ASK IT OF THE ENTRY, NEVER OF THE UNATTENDED MARKER. The first version of this check inferred entry
# ownership from marker ownership, and review measured what that costs: a live foreign marker allowed
# EVERY block path, so an interactive `/harden` in a pool-worked checkout silently lost its own
# termination contract — `edits: 7` allowed, `phase: fixing` allowed. The marker answers whether THIS
# session is unattended and nothing else; it is a different question about a different file, and the
# two coincide only in the incident above.
#
# An UNSTAMPED entry keeps the behaviour that predates this check, so nothing is relaxed on the
# strength of a missing field, and an indeterminate walk keeps it too: losing the unattended guard back
# is the more expensive direction, since that guard exists for a run that died at 1365 turns with no PR.
# A DEAD owner allows, and the reason first written here was wrong twice over, so it is stated properly:
# it is NOT that nobody can advance that run (`claude --resume` is a new pid on the same conversation,
# and a fresh `/harden` in the same directory simply overwrites the entry), and it is NOT the two
# damaging remedies above, which both need a LIVE foreign owner to damage. It allows because a pid that
# no longer exists is not evidence that anything is in flight, and holding a session to a contract on
# that evidence is what `STALE_AFTER` already did six hours late. Note what is therefore NOT pinned by
# this rung alone: for a dead pid the walk answers 1 anyway, so the liveness test only changes the
# answer when `ps` is unusable mid-walk.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT FIX, restated after worktrees. The key is the WORKING TREE, not the
# repository, and under the pool driver each ticket is worked in its own `git worktree` — so two runs
# on one repository have two keys and two entries, which is what makes concurrent tickets safe. What
# is NOT fixed is two sessions in the SAME directory, which is the interactive case: they key alike
# and the later writer wins, the loser's stamp simply overwritten. `owner` tells one session's entry
# from another's there; it does not give them one entry each.
#
# The key is also the PHYSICAL path now (`pwd -P`), matching `gate-state`, which writes it with
# `realpath`. They used to disagree — logical here, resolved there — and a mismatch finds no entry,
# which is this hook's fail-OPEN case.
