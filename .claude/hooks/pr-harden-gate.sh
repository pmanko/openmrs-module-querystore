# Stop-hook gate for the `pr-harden` skill's termination contract.
#
# The contract: a /pr-harden run is complete only when the SHA IT IS HANDING OVER has been reviewed
# with ZERO blocking findings, and — where a verifier ran at all — verified on that same sha. Edit
# counts are irrelevant here, and as of harden 0.34.0 they are irrelevant THERE too, so this is no
# longer a contrast between the two skills. In a full round the fixer implements the non-blocking
# findings as well, so a round that edits has not thereby found anything that blocks; what outlives
# that, in a blocking-only round where the two nearly coincide, is whose number it is.
# Only a reviewer's blocking count can end the run — an edit count would hand the exit to the fixer,
# whose work is the thing being judged — and the reviewer that produced it must have been a fresh
# agent. See the skill.
#
# THE CONDITION IS A PROPERTY OF THE ARTIFACT, NOT A PAST EVENT, and it used to be the latter. A
# reviewer clears sha N; FINISH then applies that round's non-blocking findings, commits and pushes
# sha N+1; "a review round reported zero blocking findings" stays true, because it was true of N and
# nothing makes it false. So this gate released a handover whose head no reviewer had ever seen —
# every run on which the terminating round raised any non-blocking finding at all, which is the
# normal case. The run records say those edits are not cosmetic: a whitespace normal form defined
# twice, a citation carve-out pinned at only two markers, an assertion that pinned nothing. The
# verifier half is the same hole from the other side — FINISH runs one on the merging head and its
# finding has no round left to reach. `reviewed_shas` has been recorded in this file since the skill
# was written, and the skill's step 1 compares it against the INCOMING head at the start of a round
# (two rounds reviewing one sha is a round wasted); what nothing compared it against was the head
# being HANDED OVER, which is the comparison below.
#
# Contract with the skill: it writes an entry keyed by the repo it is working in:
#
#   { "/abs/path/to/repo": { "pr": 93, "round": 3, "blocking": 2, "phase": "reviewed",
#                            "ts": 1755400000, "override": false,
#                            "awaiting": [ { "agent": "review r3", "since": 1755400000 } ] } }
#
# `awaiting` is what makes an unattended run possible at all. Every phase of this pipeline delegates
# to a background subagent — the refutation gate, and each round's reviewer, fixer and verifier — and
# while one is outstanding the orchestrator has NOTHING to do but yield. Without this field a run
# waiting correctly is indistinguishable from a run that quit, and the gate blocks the former: the
# design assumed synchronous phases and every real phase is asynchronous. So a non-empty, fresh
# `awaiting` allows the yield. That is not a concession — the harness re-invokes the orchestrator when
# the agent completes, so yielding mid-await does not end the run, it is how the run proceeds.
#
# THAT PREMISE HOLDS IN FULL ONLY FOR AN ATTENDED SESSION, and taking it as universal is what let two
# unattended runs die here. When a `claude -p` turn ends, the process stops a background agent still
# running 600 s later and exits without re-invoking anyone (the skill's State section carries the
# measurement). Measured 2026-08-26: issue #297 wrote
# `awaiting=[{agent: "refute plan #297 pass 1"}]`, narrated "dispatched the refutation gate. Here is
# where things stand", and ended — 51 turns, no PR, its plan and reproduction discarded; the gate
# allowed it, silently, because allowing is exit 0. Issue #310 died with the same signature in
# /harden pass 3, at 1365 turns and $76.72. So the allow is now scoped to attended sessions and an
# unattended yield is blocked with an instruction to collect the agent in-turn. Hooks DO reach `-p`
# sessions — probed the same day, feedback delivered and captured in the stream — so the absence of
# any gate text in those two logs was never evidence that the hook had not run.
#
# The obligation this puts on the skill: CLEAR `awaiting` the moment a result arrives. An entry left
# behind would let the run stop for real, which is the one thing this hook exists to prevent — so the
# allow is bounded by AWAIT_TTL as well, and an agent that has not returned within it is treated as
# dead rather than outstanding.
#
# awaiting non-empty, fresh -> a background agent this run delegated to is outstanding; ALLOW the
#                              yield, whatever the phase says. Bounded by AWAIT_TTL.
# phase "building"      -> a resolve-ticket run is in flight and has not opened its PR yet; block.
# phase "init"/"fixing" -> a run is in flight and the head it will hand over is not reviewed yet; block.
# phase "reviewed", blocking > 0  -> another round is required; block.
# phase "reviewed", blocking == 0 -> converged; allow.
# override == true                -> the skill took the labelled override; allow (on the record).
# no entry                        -> no pr-harden run in flight here; allow.
#
# The `phase` field is what closes the hole the /harden gate leaves open: an entry written before
# the first review still blocks, so a run cannot end by never having reviewed at all.
#
# FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS. A gate that wedges every future turn in every repo is far worse than one that
# occasionally lets an early stop through, so every ambiguous case allows the stop: no state file,
# unreadable or malformed JSON, no jq, no entry for this directory, a missing or unparseable
# blocking count, an unrecognised phase, or an entry older than STALE_AFTER (a run that was
# abandoned, crashed, or /clear-ed). Only a present, fresh, parseable entry that explicitly says
# "not converged" blocks.

# WHOSE ENTRY IS THIS? Measured live 2026-08-26
# (~/.claude/skill-lessons/2026-08-26-pwd-keyed-gate-false-positive.md): this state is keyed on the
# CHECKOUT, so an interactive session opened in a checkout the pool was working was stopped by an entry
# belonging to a different live `claude -p /resolve-ticket` run. The entry was present, fresh and
# parseable, so every fail-open case here correctly declined to cover it — they enumerate the cases
# where the ENTRY is unusable, never the case where it is perfectly good and somebody else's. Both
# remedies the block then offers damage the owner: `override: true` disarms the live run's gate for the
# rest of its life, and "continue the phases" puts a second session in one worktree.
#
# So the skill stamps `owner` with its own claude pid (`$PPID` from a tool shell IS that process, and
# the hook is a child of it, so the ancestry test above answers "did I write this entry").
#
# ASK IT OF THE ENTRY, NEVER OF THE UNATTENDED MARKER. The first version of this check inferred entry
# ownership from marker ownership, and review measured what that costs: a live foreign marker allowed
# EVERY block path, so an interactive `/harden` in a pool-worked checkout silently lost its own
# termination contract — `edits: 7` allowed, `phase: fixing` allowed. The marker answers whether THIS
# session is unattended and nothing else; it is a different question about a different file, and the
# two coincide only in the incident above.
#
# An UNSTAMPED entry keeps the behaviour that predates this check, so nothing is relaxed on the
# strength of a missing field, and an indeterminate walk keeps it too: losing the unattended guard back
# is the more expensive direction, since that guard exists for a run that died at 1365 turns with no PR.
# A DEAD owner allows, and the reason first written here was wrong twice over, so it is stated properly:
# it is NOT that nobody can advance that run (`claude --resume` is a new pid on the same conversation,
# and a fresh `/harden` in the same directory simply overwrites the entry), and it is NOT the two
# damaging remedies above, which both need a LIVE foreign owner to damage. It allows because a pid that
# no longer exists is not evidence that anything is in flight, and holding a session to a contract on
# that evidence is what `STALE_AFTER` already did six hours late. Note what is therefore NOT pinned by
# this rung alone: for a dead pid the walk answers 1 anyway, so the liveness test only changes the
# answer when `ps` is unusable mid-walk.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT FIX, restated after worktrees. The key is the WORKING TREE, not the
# repository, and under the pool driver each ticket is worked in its own `git worktree` — so two runs
# on one repository have two keys and two entries, which is what makes concurrent tickets safe. What
# is NOT fixed is two sessions in the SAME directory, which is the interactive case: they key alike
# and the later writer wins, the loser's stamp simply overwritten. `owner` tells one session's entry
# from another's there; it does not give them one entry each.
#
# The key is also the PHYSICAL path now (`pwd -P`), matching `gate-state`, which writes it with
# `realpath`. They used to disagree — logical here, resolved there — and a mismatch finds no entry,
# which is this hook's fail-OPEN case.
