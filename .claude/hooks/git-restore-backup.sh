# PreToolUse(Bash) safety net for `git checkout -- <path>` / `git restore <path>`.
#
# WHY THIS IS A BACKUP AND NOT A BLOCKER. The failure it exists for: a mutation probe undone with
# `git checkout -- <path>` on a file that also carried uncommitted INTENDED work discarded that work
# too. It is REJECTED.md's largest recurrence class — 9 incidents across 7 records when that ledger was
# read on 2026-08-27 (#302, #284, #268, #269 twice, #250 twice, #308, #317), where this comment had
# stood at 5/4 since it was written. Read the ledger, not this line; it is a count in a comment, which
# is what the figure above went stale as. In #302 it shipped a commit whose message described changes
# absent from its diff; in #269 it reverted a javadoc correction that then survived three review passes
# before an agent re-found it.
#
# The obvious hook — refuse when the path has uncommitted modifications — is WRONG, and that matters
# enough to record here so nobody "fixes" this script into it. At the moment of a legitimate
# restore-after-mutation the file is ALWAYS modified: that modification IS the mutation being undone.
# The dangerous case (intended work + mutation) and the safe case (mutation only) are indistinguishable
# from the file's state at restore time; telling them apart needs history this hook does not have. A
# blocker on that predicate fires on every correct use, and a hook with that false-positive rate gets
# disabled, which is strictly worse than no hook.
#
# What IS decidable is the harm. Every record describes the loss as SILENT and discovered later. So:
# copy each modified tracked file aside BEFORE the destructive command runs, outside the repo, and tell
# the model where. Nothing is blocked, there are no false positives, and a loss becomes one `cp` from
# recovery instead of a re-derivation.
#
# OUTSIDE THE REPO, deliberately: an in-repo backup would land in the `git status --porcelain` that a
# harden run reports as its edit count, fabricating an edit, and it would be invisible to the
# `git diff | shasum` residue guard, which does not report untracked paths. That count stopped being
# what the gate reads at harden 0.34.0 -- so a fabricated edit no longer demands another cycle, but
# it still corrupts the figure the run is obliged to report, and on a pre-0.34 entry (no run id and
# no verdict, the one shape still judged on the count) it does both.
#
# This does NOT replace "commit before you probe" — that is what makes the restore correct in the first
# place, and it remains the rule. This is the net under it.
#
# FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS, and never block: no jq, no git, not a repo, an unparseable payload, a cap
# exceeded, a failed copy — every one of them allows the command unchanged. The worst this script may
# ever do is fail to take a backup.
