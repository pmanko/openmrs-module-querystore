"""pool-test — exercises the driver's parallel machinery through its REAL entry points.

No simulations and no reimplementations: every case calls the function `pool-run` itself calls, over
a real git repository, real `git worktree` invocations, real `flock` contention between real
processes, and the real `Session`/scheduler. The one substitution is `claude.binary`, pointed at a
stub that emits stream-json — a production knob (it pins which `claude` a pool uses), not a mock of
anything this file is testing. Everything the tests assert about — isolation, leasing, locking,
scheduling, the barrier — is the shipped code path.

    Measured off this pipeline's own ledger on 2026-09-08: 32 of 34 rows are `launched_by: work`, and
    the five longest runs are all `--work` — 47.7h, 40.4h, 35.6h, 23.8h, 19.7h — every one ending
    `error`, against a declared `ticket.timeout_seconds` of 8h. `Session` carries the timeout and the
    quiet watchdog; `work_in_session` calls `Popen` directly, so neither reached the runs that
    mattered.

    It does NOT kill. An interactive session has a human who may simply be slow, and killing one on a
    clock would throw away work the driver's own bounds are allowed to throw away only because that
    path is headless. What it does is tell somebody, which is the thing that was not happening.
