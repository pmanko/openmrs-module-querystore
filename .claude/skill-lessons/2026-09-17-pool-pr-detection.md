# defect · ticket-pool driver — a merged PR reads as "the run opened no PR" · 2026-09-17
outcome: root cause verified; patch and tests **APPLIED 2026-09-20** in the retro of that window
         (`bca30ab`, `ticket-pool` 0.24.0). Written here as prepared-and-not-applied, because a pool
         run was executing the file at the time (pid 79582, #444 and #445 still in flight).
found by: asking what makes a run need a second attempt, which the 2026-09-17 wall-clock measurement
          handed on as its open question. Attempts are the largest latency multiplier in the ledger
          (#337 `att=3` -> 11.0 h, #409 `att=2` -> 9.4 h against 7.4 h in-session).

## The mechanism, one line of it

`open_prs()` asks `gh pr list --state open`, and `work_ticket` decides the outcome from that list
alone. **A PR merged before the outcome check is not an open PR**, so the run that opened it is
recorded `no-pr`.

## The evidence

Every `no-pr` row from 2026-09-13/14 had opened a PR that was merged before the driver looked. PR
times from `gh api repos/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/pulls/<n>`, ledger times from
`~/.claude/pipeline/ledger.json`:

| ticket | PR | branch | merged (UTC) | ledger `last_run` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #413 | 419 | `fix/413-unreadable-order-drug` | 09-13 20:19:15 | 09-13 20:20 |
| #421 | 423 | `fix/421-guards-that-do-not-discriminate` | 09-14 08:48:13 | 09-14 09:34 |

Each ticket's own record reads `outcome: converged` and names that PR. And the driver had the answer
in its hand while it wrote the wrong one — `pool-20260914T093719Z.md`:9-11, #315:

> recorded in the ledger as no-pr
>     cleared leftover gate state — pr-harden-state.json: phase=reviewed blocking=0 edits=None **pr=431** round=1

## Three consequences, and one more failure mode riding on the same cause

- **The attempt budget is charged for delivered work.** `max_attempts: 2`, so two false negatives put
  a ticket past the queue's own gate at `consider`.
- **`DONE = {"ready"}`**, so a ticket whose PR is merged stays re-queueable — and the queue's
  "already has an open PR" guard reads the same open-only list, so nothing there sees the merged PR
  either. That is the path on which one issue gets a second PR.
- **Every outcome the pool reports is wrong for those rows**, including the "outcomes of earlier
  tickets" block a later run prints.
- **A `ready` verdict taken from another ticket's PR.** With the real PR invisible, matching falls
  through to `pr_for_ticket`'s prose tier, which matched a bare `#294` in PR 417's body — "`main`
  gained #416 (issue #294) after this branch was reviewed". #294's ledger row therefore says
  `status=ready pr=417`, and 417 is #409's PR (`fix/409-finding-citation-extent-prose-anchored`).
  #294's own PR, 416, had been merged 09-13 before the check, which is the first defect again.

**Not established, and it should not be assumed:** that any second attempt re-did work an earlier one
had delivered. #337 reached `att=3` past a `max_attempts` of 2, which only an operator naming the
ticket can do, so the re-runs on this record were driven by a human and not by the false status. What
is measured is the wrong record, the charged attempt, the lockout and the duplicate-PR path.

**Adjacent, same file:** `load_json_str(got.stdout, [])` turns a failed `gh` call into "this
repository has no open PRs". That is the `gh` rule in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` ("treat empty output from a
`gh` subcommand as a failure") being broken by the driver that depends on it.

## The fix, prepared and tested

`open_prs` returns `None` when the ask itself failed (non-zero exit, or exit 0 with empty stdout);
new `pr_by_number` reads one PR in any state; new `outcome_pr` takes three sources in order — the
open list, then the number the run wrote into the gate entry, then nothing — and reports whether
GitHub could be asked at all. The ladder gains `unknown` for an unanswerable ask, which joins
`NEEDS_HUMAN` so a maybe-delivered ticket waits for a human rather than risking a second PR; the
queue skips a ticket it could not ask about; `pr_for_ticket`'s prose tier now requires
`Fixes|Closes|Resolves|Refs` beside the number, in either the bare or the linked form, instead of any
mention of it.

84 changed lines over 9 hunks. **16 focused cases pass** over the real functions with `sh` — the
`gh` process boundary — substituted, and two mutants prove they discriminate: reverting the prose
tier to the bare number reddens 2, deleting the gate fallback reddens 2.

**Applied 2026-09-20**, once no pool run held the file. The driver went over
`~/.claude/pipeline/pool-run` and the repo's `.claude/pipeline/pool-run` (the same file, vendored);
the 16 cases were integrated INTO `pool-test.py` as `test_pr_detection` rather than landed beside it,
since a test file nothing runs is not a test — `pool.sh` is restored in a `finally` and the stand-in
returns a real `subprocess.CompletedProcess`. Suite: **523 passed / 0 failed** (507 before). The cases
were re-calibrated after integration: against the pre-patch driver they fail 2 and then raise
`TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`. Shipped as `ticket-pool` 0.24.0 with the `unknown` row
and the correction to "everything else is retried", which the code made false. The prepared originals
stay in `~/.claude/pipeline/.pending-2026-09-17/` as the record of what was applied; the live test is
the one in `pool-test.py`.

**Not repaired by the patch, and still true: the nine wrong rows are in the ledger.** Checked
2026-09-20 — the eight `no-pr` rows still read `pr: None` with their attempts charged (#337 at 3, past
`max_attempts`), and #294 still reads `ready pr=417`. None of the nine carries the `claude-pipeline`
label today, so none is queueable and the duplicate-PR path is not live; five (#337, #276, #409, #425,
#315) are still OPEN issues, so a re-label would make it live again. Repairing them is a hand edit of
live pipeline state and belongs to an operator.

## Also fixed, and it is why this was findable

`~/.claude/bin/run-timing.py` reported `IDLE waiting on a subagent 0 min` and `?` for every latency
on the current harness, and inflated output tokens ~2.1x by summing `usage` per transcript event.
Both are corrected in place (original kept as `.bak-20260917`), and its figures now reproduce two
independently written scripts on #446. It was not vendored in this repo; two measurement passes had
leaned on it and one published wrong numbers from it, which was the argument for vendoring it at
`.claude/bin/`. **Vendored there 2026-09-20** (`bca30ab`), with its `.bak-20260917`.

## The extent, measured 2026-09-20 after the repair — it is ~4x what this record said

Repairing the nine rows this record names prompted the sibling question, and the answer changes the
record's scope. Sweeping the WHOLE ledger for rows that report no delivered PR, then asking GitHub
for every PR whose branch names that ticket:

| | rows |
|---|---|
| recording no delivered PR | 34 |
| of those, a **MERGED** PR names the ticket in its branch | **30** — 26 `error`, 4 `no-pr` |
| correctly recorded (no merged PR) | 2 — #262 (PR 372 still OPEN), #393 (no PR) |
| malformed key, the ticket passed as a URL | 2 |

**So `error` is the larger half of this defect, not `no-pr`.** The ladder checks `run["is_error"]`
before it reaches the `no-pr` branch, and both are downstream of the PR lookup — so a session that
errored AND delivered a PR the open list could not see lands on `error`, and the `error` label then
reads as the explanation. Two verified end to end: `#229` is `error` while its own record says
"converged · #229 / PR 334" (merged 2026-08-30), and `#310` is `no-pr` while its record says
"converged · #310 / PR 405" (merged 2026-09-11).

**Repaired 2026-09-20, all but one, through `write_ledger` and verified by `--outcomes`.** 9 + 26 +
3 = 38 rows; the ledger now reads 46 `ready`, 4 `error`, 2 `draft`, 1 `no-pr`.

**The reason given for holding the 26 back did not survive checking, and that is worth recording.**
The claim was that `error` carries a fact `ready` would erase. It does not, for 19 of the 26: the row
already carries the session's own `exit` code (129, 143 or 0) independently of `status`. It was true
for the other 7 — #280, #305, #353, #360, #374, #377, #387 have no `exit` field at all, and for those
`status` really was the only carrier. So the prior status is now written into `flags` on **every**
repaired row, which covers both cases with one rule and makes the repair legible in `--status`.
`exit` was asserted unchanged on every write.

**The four multi-PR tickets: three resolved on evidence, one did not.** `last_run` decides three of
them, each following its PR's merge closely while the sibling merged days earlier — #250 → 333 (3.5 h),
#336 → 368 (103 s), #338 → 376 (10 s). **#379 is the one left for a human**: three merged PRs (382 on
09-07, 386 on 09-08, 414 on 09-13) and three converged run records, against a row reading `attempts: 2`
and `last_run` 2026-09-11T13:25 — a time that matches no merge and sits between two of them. Neither
the record count nor the attempt count nor the timestamp agrees with the others.

**Still correctly recorded, and untouched:** #262 (its PR 372 is still OPEN) and #393 (no PR).

**A second defect, adjacent and separate: two ledger keys are malformed.** Both read
`openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai#https://github.com/.../issues/<n>` — the ticket was passed as a
URL and used verbatim where a number belongs. Each carries `attempts: 1`, so each is a phantom row
beside the properly-keyed one, and neither can ever match a PR. `pool-run` normalises a URL everywhere
else (the skill's table says every command takes "a `#266`, a JIRA key … or the URL"), so this is a
missed normalisation on the ledger-key path and not on the argument path. No record measures a cost.
