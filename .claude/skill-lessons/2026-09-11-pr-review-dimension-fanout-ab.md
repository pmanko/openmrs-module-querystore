outcome: measurement only — three proposals derived from it went to the Step 5 gate 2026-09-11: one parked at zero criteria met with six limbs killed, two applied as ledger entries after revision. No skill changed. See REJECTED.md, 2026-09-11 block.

This is capture, not derivation. It records what one controlled comparison measured, so the next
attempt at fanning out a review starts from measured ground. **Origin: a design question** — would
`/pr-review` produce better reviews if each review dimension got its own agent? Nothing was posted to
GitHub; the PR under review was not touched.

## Design

Subject `openmrs/openmrs-core` PR 6551 (TRUNK-6669, restrict users to assigned locations), pinned at
head `b7cd909d245086fa10691496f88e5ec6971b77c2`, merge base `28e3bab9e206170df7fd43cf709495b6d45fe16a`
(from GitHub's compare API — the local clone is shallow, so `git merge-base` returns nothing and a
naive `origin/master...` diff hands every agent the wrong base). +216/-6 over 8 files. Chosen because
authorization semantics plus a liquibase changeset make every dimension load-bearing: the condition
most favourable to fan-out.

- **arm A** — one fresh agent, `pr-review` Steps 1-3 in full, single context, all six dimensions.
- **arm B** — six fresh agents, one per dimension named at `pr-review:97`, then one merger applying
  Step 4's rules, explicitly forbidden from generating findings of its own.
- Both arms blinded to the PR's existing review conversation, so the 8 human inline comments could
  serve as an independent oracle. Symmetric deviation, recorded: it costs both arms their dedup
  behaviour and neither arm's generation.
- Arm A ran alone; arm B's six contended with each other. The handicap runs **against** arm B.
- Adjudication by a fresh agent, arm labels stripped, order shuffled, evidence text scrubbed of
  within-arm cross-references (10 found and neutralised; a residual-leak check ran after).

## Measured

**Precision does not separate the arms.** The blinded adjudicator rated **20 of 20 findings REAL** —
no NOISE, no PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED, no REAL_OVERSTATED, `anchor_wrong` on none.

**Defect coverage.** 20 findings collapse to 12 distinct defects by the adjudicator's own equivalence
classes: 7 found by both arms, 4 by arm B only, 1 by arm A only. Arm A's one unique defect (a
double-duty constant) *was* found by arm B's conventions reviewer and dropped by arm B's merger with
the other nits, so raw arm B covered 12 of 12, merged arm B 11 of 12, arm A 8 of 12.

**Severity accuracy, which is the sharper result.** Arm A filed 2 blocking where the adjudicator
found 3, under-calling the `getAllowedLocations` privilege hole as a suggestion. Arm B filed 3 of 3,
with no over-call. On that finding arm A reasoned from the code; the security reviewer ran the
exploit with a positive control (same caller: `APIAuthenticationException` on `getUser(1)`, location
data returned from `getAllowedLocations`) and traced it to `AOPConfig` advising `@Service` only while
`HibernateUserDAO` is `@Repository`.

**Verification depth.** Arm B returned verified answers for 3 of arm A's 5 `could_not_verify`
entries: it ran `DatabaseUpdaterDatabaseIT` (which arm A skipped as integration-profile) and
confirmed the changeset count; it proved the liquibase changeset *is* covered in CI by renaming
`location_id` and watching `ValidateHibernateMappingsDatabaseIT` fail, then killed the candidate
finding rather than raising it; and it reproduced in-session the transaction abort arm A could only
file as a question, isolating the cause by removing the native delete and seeing the exception
persist.

**Volume and the merge.** Raw arm B produced 25 findings (5 blocking, 12 suggestions, 4 questions,
4 nits) against arm A's 9. The merger cut 25 to 11 — 6 merge groups consuming 13 findings, 7 dropped,
every nit discarded — and stayed inside its authority, routing 4 of its own observations to a
did-not-add list. The predicted flood appeared in raw form and the merge step absorbed it.

**Cost.** arm A 194,690 tokens / 66 tool calls / 22.6 min. arm B 1,256,194 tokens / 388 tool calls /
35.6 min (25.2 min lens wave, a wave costing its slowest member, plus a 10.4 min merge). Ratio
6.45× tokens for 1.58× wall clock. Adjudicator, charged to neither arm: 183,588 tokens / 21.5 min.

**Per-reviewer yield.** security 2 unique defects and the corrected severity; test coverage 0 unique
but one blocker and two could-not-verify resolutions; correctness 0 unique but the question→blocking
upgrade; solution fit 0 unique, and the only approach-level alternative anyone proposed
(`onDelete="CASCADE"` on the PR's own unshipped FK, with in-tree precedent, deleting the native query
and its caveat together); performance 1 unique, non-blocking; conventions 1 unique, non-blocking,
plus 3 nits the merger dropped.

## What the human oracle measured, which was not the A/B

The 8 captured comments are 4 findings plus 4 author replies, and all four findings were marked
resolved *at* the reviewed sha (the author's fix commits are ancestors of it). Recall: arm A 3 of 4,
arm B 4 of 4. The finding arm A missed is the residue of a fix — the null-collection repair still
lets `setLocations(null)` restore null.

More useful than the recall number: **both arms reopened two threads the human review had closed.**
A maintainer asked for a regression test, the author added one, the thread closed — both arms mutated
the fix away and watched the test stay green. A maintainer described the session-cache risk as stale
data and "safe in current code paths", the author shipped a comment saying exactly that, the thread
closed on "good catch" — the behaviour is a `TransientPropertyValueException` that aborts the
transaction, reachable from the PR's own new test plus one ordinary query. Both are the case
`pr-review` Step 1 already names (*"fixed" is a claim, not evidence*), here accepted by two humans
and a review bot.

## Refuted — a claim this run's own orchestrator published and the run broke

- **"The toolchain for this repo is JDK 8."** The orchestrator ran
  `mvn help:evaluate -Dexpression=javaCompilerVersion` in the main checkout, which sits on a stale
  local branch, and briefed all seven agents accordingly. The pom **at the reviewed sha** sets
  `maven.compiler.release=21`; JDK 8 dies in spotless before any test runs. Arm A found it mid-run and
  five of six lenses reported it independently. A value proved present somewhere is not a value proved
  on the path in question — which is `pr-review:88`'s own rule, applied to a property instead of a
  method. The brief was left uncorrected for arm B on purpose, to hold the per-agent condition equal
  (PROTOCOL.md, Amendment 1).

## Limits this run cannot argue past

- **n=1**, on a PR selected because it favoured the treatment. A dimension effect and a this-PR
  effect are not separable here.
- **20 of 20 REAL is suspiciously clean.** Either both arms were disciplined — both reports do carry
  killed candidates — or the adjudicator was not adversarial enough. A second adjudicator told to
  refute rather than verify would settle it and was not run.
- **Both arms were blinded to the PR conversation**, so nothing here measures whether six reviewers
  each re-deriving the same thread state makes deduplication worse. That is the obvious place
  fan-out would cost something, and this run is silent on it.
- The handicap ran against arm B and arm B still won, so the direction is safe; but arm B's wall-clock
  advantage would shrink on an uncontended machine.
- **The 20-of-20 precision result was measured on MERGED arm B only.** `adjudication-input.json` holds
  arm A's 9 plus merged arm B's 11; the 14 raw lens findings the merger consumed or dropped were never
  adjudicated. **Raw fan-out precision is unmeasured**, and the merge pass is what protected it — the
  same merge pass this record parks as an open question. Established at the Step 5 gate, 2026-09-11.
- **The window contains evidence cutting the other way that this run did not use.**
  `2026-09-11-openmrs-module-chartsearchai-387.md`:39-40 — a field-naming defect "Raised independently
  by two lenses, the second told nothing about the first · cost: 1 cycle + a rename". That is the
  duplication cost this record says it cannot speak to, sitting in the same window. Found by the
  refuter, not by the orchestrator who had read that record.
- **The 20-of-20 REAL result is UNEXPLAINED, and should not be cited as evidence that either arm was
  disciplined.** This record flagged it as "clean enough to suspect the instrument" and said the
  settling experiment had not been run. A second run (`2026-09-12-…-ab2.md`) used an adjudicator
  briefed to *refute* and returned 4 of 17 REAL_OVERSTATED and 4 `anchor_wrong` against this run's 0
  and 0 over 20 — but the 2026-09-12 gate established that **stance is not identified as the cause**:
  those four `anchor_wrong` are one duplicate group created by that PR's ticket-half living at an
  untouched line, run 1's subject held three genuine blocking defects where run 2's held none (which
  mechanically produces more overstatement), one of the four overstatements came from a second pass
  an in-brief distribution warning triggered rather than from the stance, and run 2's adjudicator
  brief was not archived. So: this figure is not evidence about the arms, and the reason it is clean
  is not established. What survives both stances is that neither run produced a single NOISE finding.
