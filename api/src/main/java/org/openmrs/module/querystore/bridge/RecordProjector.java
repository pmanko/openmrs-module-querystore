/**
 * The {@code serialize → partition → dispatch} projection the events consumer
 * ({@code CoreServiceEventListener}) runs to write a saved/voided/purged record into the read store.
 * (It was originally shared with the AOP migration bridge to guarantee parity; the bridge has since
 * been removed and events is the sole sync path — ADR Decision 12.)
 *
 * <p>Per-type behaviour (which records the save touches; whether a purge sweeps a patient's whole
 * chart) lives on the {@link ClinicalRecordSerializer} — the per-type bean the consumer resolves —
 * via {@link ClinicalRecordSerializer#collectTree} and
 * {@link ClinicalRecordSerializer#bulkDeletePatientUuidFor}, so module-contributed types (ADR
 * Decision 13) get the same treatment without touching this class.
 *
 * <p><b>Disposition is per-node, not per-call.</b> Each node in {@code collectTree(root)} is routed
 * by its own {@code voided} flag (voided → delete, per ADR Decision 10; otherwise serialize +
 * index). {@code purge} is the only call-level override — every node is deleted unconditionally
 * because the core row is gone. The consumer passes {@code purge=true} only for {@code
 * PurgeServiceEvent}; every other event passes {@code false} and lets the entity's own state decide.
 *
 * <p><b>Synchronous serialize, asynchronous write.</b> Serialization runs on the caller's thread
 * (inside the originating transaction, so lazy navigations resolve against an open session); the
 * embed + index/delete is handed to {@code dispatcher} to run after commit. Per-node failures inside
 * the dispatched task are caught so one poison record cannot skip its siblings.
