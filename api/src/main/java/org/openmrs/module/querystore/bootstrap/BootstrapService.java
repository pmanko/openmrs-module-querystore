	 * version-protection invariant for races with concurrent steady-state writes. Concurrent calls
	 * for the same patient serialize on a per-patient lock; concurrent calls for different patients
	 * run in parallel. Per-record and per-type failures are isolated and logged; the method returns
	 * after attempting every type.
	 *
	 * <p>Persists no progress row — the per-patient cursor lives only for the call. A bootstrapper
	 * that declares no per-patient story (the {@link TypeBootstrapper#fetchPageForPatient} default
	 * throws) is skipped at debug-log level instead of failing the whole call.
