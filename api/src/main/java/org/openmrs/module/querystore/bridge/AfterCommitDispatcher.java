/**
 * Hands a projection task to the {@link BridgeExecutor} once the originating transaction has
 * committed, so indexing never runs against uncommitted state and never blocks the clinical
 * request thread (ADR Decision 12 "Migration bridge"). When no transaction is active the task is
 * submitted immediately; at-least-once semantics still hold via the bootstrap reconciliation path.
 *
 * <p>Failures inside the dispatched task are caught and logged here. The aspect's contract per the
 * ADR is "log and swallow"; per-document failures must never bubble back to the clinical thread
 * (which has already returned anyway) and must not poison subsequent dispatches.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread context.</b> {@link BridgeExecutor}'s worker threads do not carry an OpenMRS
 * {@code UserContext}, but the dispatched indexer transitively reads global properties (the
 * configured embedding provider bean, then its model/vocab paths) and so requires one. We resolve
 * that here by handing the actual task to {@link Daemon#runInDaemonThreadAndWait} from inside the
 * pool thread once a {@link DaemonToken} has been wired in. The pool thread blocks until the
 * daemon thread completes, preserving the executor's bounded-concurrency contract; without the
 * token (unit tests that drive the runnable directly) the task is run inline so existing
 * assertions still observe side effects.
