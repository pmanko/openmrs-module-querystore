/**
 * Shared executor for the events-first sync pipeline (ADR Decision 12). The events consumer's
 * after-commit dispatcher hands projection tasks here so indexing runs off the clinical request
 * thread, after the originating transaction has committed. Pool size is two threads — enough headroom to overlap
 * one embedding with the next document's submission, but no wider because the default ONNX
 * embedder's {@code embed} is {@code synchronized} (a larger pool would just queue against the
 * embedder's monitor).
 *
 * <p>Wired as a Spring bean with {@code init-method="start"} and {@code destroy-method="stop"} so
 * the executor's lifecycle tracks the module's. Failures inside submitted tasks are caught and
 * logged at the dispatcher, never here — this class is a plain executor wrapper.
